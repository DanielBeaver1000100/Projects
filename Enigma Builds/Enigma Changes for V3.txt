checkForLetter can should be changed out for a dictionary and use the checkDictionary function to see if a letter exists

letterToNum and numToLetter should also be dictionary to get rid of the for loop

when choosing roter numbers and orientation make the inputs a try so it doesnt crash is someone puts in a letter

in the encoding process make the copy sequence a switch case to reduce time 

make a version that can encode txt files 

When prompted "Do you wish to continue" after saying y the original spin setup runs again
the spin function doesnt spin the roters all the way
the mirror logic seems off
